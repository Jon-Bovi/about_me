    <h3>A Brief Bio</h3>
    <p>
      I've managed to reach the critical age of 24 in much the same way most people do: sailing the seas without knowing how to sail. My childhood was split between Colorado and Southern California, both outdoor wonderlands for a kid. Nothing particularly notable happened my formative years in which I mainly focused on slaying exams (I was a competitive twerp), running cross country, and going to the beach every day. Fall of 2010, I went to college at UC Berkeley, but quickly withdrew to take time to discover what I actually wanted to do. Later I enrolled at Colorado State University in Geology, which I love, but I was swayed by a couple of coding classes to hold off on my degree and instead try to get into the tech scene as quickly as possible. When I discovered Code Fellows I jumped, packed my car, and shipped my life to Seattle. I'm finally getting this sailing thing figured out #corny
