            <h3>A Brief Bio</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Ford Fowler, and I'm an aspiring web developer. I've managed to reach the critical age of 24 in much the same way most people do: stumbling blindly. My childhood was split between Colorado and Southern California, both outdoor wonderlands for a kid. Fall of 2010, I went to college at UC Berkeley, but quickly withdrew
                to take time to discover what I actually wanted to do. Later I enrolled at Colorado State University in Geology, which I love, but I was swayed by a couple of coding classes to hold off on my degree and instead try to get into the tech
                scene as quickly as possible. When I discovered Code Fellows I jumped, packed my car, and shipped my life to Seattle.</p>
